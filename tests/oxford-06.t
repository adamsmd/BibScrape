  abstract = {A silent self-stabilizing asynchronous distributed algorithm is given for constructing a \textit{k}-dominating set, and hence a \textit{k}-clustering, of a connected network of processes with unique IDs and no designated leader. The algorithm is comparison-based, takes \textit{O}(\textit{k}) time and uses \textit{O}(\textit{k} log \textit{n}) space per process, where \textit{n} is the size of the network. It is known that finding a minimum \textit{k}-dominating set is {\ensuremath{\mathscr{N}}}{\ensuremath{\mathscr{P}}}-hard. A lower bound is given, showing that any comparison-based algorithm for the \textit{k}-clustering problem that produces clusters of average size more than 2 in the worst case takes {\textgreek{W}}(\textit{diam}) time, where \textit{diam} is the diameter of the network.},
